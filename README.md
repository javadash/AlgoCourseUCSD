# UCSD Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
***
> I learnt the first step to becoming a software engineer at Google is learning and understanding Data Structures and Algorithms,
> so here goes that first step. These are my solutions to the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) Coursera MOOC.
> I am getting inspiration from [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) hence, I plan to learn from his fantastic material, do programming challenges and read some books along the way.
> *Wish me luck!* :muscle:
